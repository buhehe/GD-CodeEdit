Code Edit 4 Grim dawn

# Guide
Here is the DLL analysis & editÂ for grim dawn.

The target here is to build the MAX attribute value for every euqipments in Grim Dawn.

The equation is

item's attribute value := item's dbr[item's base attribute value] * (1+item's seed {operates with } item's dbr[item's jitter]).

for example:

A item has 5 base fire damage,its jitter is 25,then the attribute value is between 5 * 75%=3.75 and 5 * 125%=6.25.

The final attribute value is revalant to item's seed,the seed is a RNG.So that the attribute values are RNG multiply with jitter(from -1 * jitter to 1 * jitter).

We skip the item seed calculation to make the MAX varibles.

Special thanks to Cryptomancer,with his post about the execution to skip item seed. http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=60590.
